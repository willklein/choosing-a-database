# Choosing a database

How do we choose a database for personal projects? I'll walk through some popular options,  how I approach evaluating them, and how I get started building out the schema so I can start building as quickly as possible.

## What I've used

- MySQL
- Microsoft SQL Server
- MongoDB
- Oracle ðŸ˜¬
- MySQL again!
- Supabase

## What I've heard about

- Supabase
- Turso
- IndexedDB
- DrizzleORM

## What I'm building

- something for myself
- something others will use
- seems relational

## How I choose

- relational vs document model
- ORM or not
- goals
