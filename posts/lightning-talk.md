# Choosing a database

How do we choose a database for personal projects? I'll walk through some popular options, how I approach evaluating them, and how I make a decision I can live with.

## Questions

who is:
- full-stack (at least 20% of front or backend)
- front-end
- back-end

who has:
- picked a database solution?
- written database queries?
- defined a database schema?
- done not much with databases but hopes to understand more?

## What I've used

- MySQL
- Microsoft SQL Server
- MongoDB
- Oracle ðŸ˜¬
- Firebase ðŸ”¥
- MySQL again! w/ [Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/)
- Supabase
- JSON files

## Considerations

- what underlying database?
- what provider do I go with?
- am I writing queries?

- relational vs document model?
